## Platforms

You should be able to compile Hexium successfully on the following platforms (older and newer versions might work):

* Certain Linux distrobutions (Arch, Debian and Ubuntu are tested and works)
* Windows 10 and 11 using WSL2

## Get the source code

You can get the entire source code by cloning the git repo recursively:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/HexiumOS/Hexium
```

To update an existing clone you can use the following commands:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Dependencies

To build Hexium you will need the following:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (nightly toolchain)
- [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) package manager
- Rust `rust-src` component for `x86_64-unknown-none`
- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) emulator
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control
- GNU [xorriso](https://www.gnu.org/software/xorriso/)
- GNU [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

<summary>Downloading Dependecies</summary>

### Rust and Cargo

To download Rust on Linux or MacOS run the following command:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Then you will need to install a linker:

#### MacOS

```
xcode-select --install
```

#### Linux

On linux you will typically need either GCC or Clang. For example on Ubuntu you can get it by installing the `build-essential` package and on Arch you will need to install the `base-devel` package

### `rust-src` component

On both Linux and MacOS you will need to run the following command:

```
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly-2025-04-03-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### QEMU

#### MacOS

```
brew install qemu
```

#### Debian-based

```
sudo apt install qemu
```

#### Fedora

```
sudo dnf install qemu
```

#### Arch-based

```
sudo pacman -Syu qemu
```

### Git

#### MacOS

```
brew install git
```

#### Debian-based

```
sudo apt install git
```

#### Fedora

```
sudo dnf install git
```

#### Arch-based

```
sudo pacman -Syu git
```

### GNU `xorriso`

#### MacOS

```
brew install xorriso
```

#### Debian-based

```
sudo apt install xorisso
```

#### Fedora

```
sudo dnf install xorisso
```

#### Arch-based

```
sudo pacman -Syu xorisso
```

### GNU `make`

#### MacOS

```
brew install make
```

#### Debian-based

```
sudo apt install make
```

#### Fedora

```
sudo dnf install make
```
